Atrip is an independent electronic music producer residing in Patagonia Argentina, which since 1999 has been active in making very diverse multimedia productions, with styles ranging from trip hop to electrofunk. The productions have a great organic content since many sounds are made with homemade, experimental, ethnic, traditional, acoustic, electronic instruments and even everyday stuff, as well as using sounds of nature in their compositions.-
